# *Who Am I ?*
<br>
I'm a back-end developer student. I live in France in Brittany. Since last year I am very interested in web development. I got my front end diploma last year, and i just decided to continu this way. Actually, I can create some fun and dynamics websites using JavaScript, HTML CSS. I feel more and more comfortable and involved in this job.

To increase my skills as a developer, I like to programme some little funny games to exercise, take online courses, I like to use scratch too to learn more about algorithme and other things... Iâ€™m currently working on C language and Python and I'm exited to learn how to manage a database so i can make full of different projects !
