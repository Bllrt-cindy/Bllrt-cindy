# *Who Am I ?*
<br>
I am a back-end developer student living in Brittany, France. I have been highly interested in web development since last year. I obtained my front-end diploma last year and have decided to continue pursuing this path. Currently, I am proficient in creating dynamic and entertaining websites using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I feel increasingly comfortable and engaged in this profession.

To enhance my skills as a developer, I enjoy programming small, fun games for practice. I also take online courses and utilize Scratch to further my understanding of algorithms and other concepts. Presently, I am working on improving my skills in C language and Python. I am particularly excited to learn database management as it will enable me to undertake diverse projects!

### *What i like to do ?*
<br>

I enjoy using Inkscape as it allows me to create my own characters when I use Scratch, for example. In my life, I balance activities I love, such as painting, drawing, dancing, and singing. Sometimes, I also like to organize photo shoots. I'm a fan of Zelda games, and while I'm not exactly a movie lover, I do enjoy them to some extent ðŸ˜‚.

Lastly, I enjoy personal growth and learning new things. I seek thrills, such as learning pixel art and even trying skydiving.
<br>

#### *Here are some things I project to do :*
<br>

I want to draw my own logo just for fun.
I want to realise a GUY C and Python interface.
I want to improve my capacities to be able to do more than what my trainers required in as much time as it takes me today
I have some ideas to use database and I'm just waiting to know how to do exactly !
I'm learning how to draw with pixels.
